##Industrial Air Quality Monitoring System for Chemical Leak Detection:

This project focuses on developing a **real-time embedded system** for monitoring industrial air quality and detecting **toxic gas leaks** using sensor integration and signal processing techniques.  
It demonstrates expertise in **Embedded C**, **Tiva C microcontroller (TM4C123G)** programming, and **MATLAB-based analysis**.

##Project Overview

Chemical leaks in industrial environments can cause severe safety hazards.  
This system continuously monitors air quality parameters such as **temperature, gas concentration, and sound anomalies**, triggering early alerts in case of unsafe conditions.

##Main features:
- Real-time multi-sensor data acquisition.  
- Firmware written in **C** using Energia IDE for Tiva LaunchPad.  
- Signal filtering and data visualization using **MATLAB/Simulink**.  
- Wireless monitoring via **Bluetooth** communication.
